# Project 1: vector operations

### Problem statement:
Implement the following functions for `std::vector<double>` and `std::vector<int>` as algebraic vectors:
- `std::vector<double>`:
  - unary and binary operators `+` and `-`;
  - `*` dot product operator;
  - `%` cross product operator;
  - `||` operator for collinearity check;
  - `&&` operator for co-directionality check;
  - `operator>>` that takes size as its first argument, then values;
  - `operator<<` that prints all vector values separated by whitespace and ends with a line break;
  - `reverse` function that puts vector elements in reversed order;
- `std::vector<int>`:
  - `|` and `&` operators that apply corresponding bitwise operations.
