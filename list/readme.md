# Project 3: list

### Problem statement:
Implement analogue of the `std::list` class. The required methods are listed in the header file, they must behave the same way as [`std::list`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list) methods do.

Any work with memory must be done via the allocator passed as an argument.
